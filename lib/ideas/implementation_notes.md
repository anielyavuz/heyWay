# Implementation Notes - Pulse App

## Completed Features ✅

### 1. Map Migration (maplibre_gl → flutter_map)
**Implementation:**
- Removed old maplibre_gl dependency to avoid Apple bitcode issues
- Integrated flutter_map with OpenStreetMap tiles
- Added multiple map styles (Light, Dark, Standard, Terrain, Ultra Roads)
- Custom marker system with venue categorization
- Static location switch for testing

**Files Modified:**
- `pubspec.yaml` - Updated dependencies
- `lib/screens/discover_screen.dart` - Complete rewrite
- `lib/theme/map_styles.dart` - Map tile configurations

**Test Instructions:**
```bash
flutter run
# Navigate to Discover tab
# Toggle static location switch
# Test map zoom, pan, and style switching
# Verify markers display correctly for venues
```

### 2. Core Firestore Collections
**Implementation:**
- `AppUser` model with privacy settings, stats, and profile data
- `Venue` model with location, rating, categories
- `Pulse` model with mood, visibility, media references
- `FirestoreService` with CRUD operations and real-time streams
- Batch operations for data consistency

**Files Created:**
- `lib/models/app_user.dart`
- `lib/models/venue.dart` 
- `lib/models/pulse.dart`
- `lib/services/firestore_service.dart`
- `test/models/firestore_models_test.dart`

**Test Instructions:**
```bash
flutter test test/models/firestore_models_test.dart
# Verify all model serialization/deserialization tests pass
# Test copyWith methods work correctly
```

### 3. User Profile System
**Implementation:**
- Complete profile display with avatar, stats, privacy settings
- Profile editing with image picker (camera/gallery)
- Privacy controls (public/friends/private)
- Avatar upload to Firebase Storage
- Authentication provider integration

**Files Created:**
- `lib/screens/profile_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/edit_profile_screen.dart`
- `lib/providers/auth_provider.dart`
- `lib/services/storage_service.dart`

**Test Instructions:**
```bash
flutter run
# Sign in with anonymous auth
# Navigate to Profile tab
# Tap Edit Profile
# Test avatar upload (camera/gallery)
# Update display name and privacy settings
# Verify changes persist after app restart
```

### 4. Venue Caching System
**Implementation:**
- Smart caching layer between Foursquare API and Firestore
- Automatic venue caching to reduce API calls
- Fallback to cached data when API fails
- Integration with existing venue search provider

**Files Created:**
- `lib/services/venue_cache_service.dart`

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/providers/venue_search_provider.dart` - Added cache integration

**Test Instructions:**
```bash
flutter run
# Navigate to Discover tab
# Search for venues (e.g., "coffee")
# Check Firestore console - venues should be cached
# Turn off internet, search again - should show cached results
# Verify API calls are reduced on subsequent searches
```

## Current Architecture

### Data Flow
```
UI Layer (Screens/Widgets)
    ↓
Provider Layer (State Management)
    ↓
Service Layer (Business Logic)
    ↓
Model Layer (Data Models)
    ↓
Firebase (Storage/Database)
```

### Key Services
- **FirestoreService**: Database operations
- **StorageService**: File uploads
- **VenueCacheService**: API caching
- **PoiProviderManager**: External API abstraction
- **AuthProvider**: Authentication state

### Providers
- **AuthProvider**: User authentication state
- **ThemeProvider**: Dark/light mode
- **LocationProvider**: GPS location
- **VenueSearchProvider**: Venue search with caching

## Next Steps (From steps.txt)

### 1. Firestore Security Rules ⏳
- Implement proper access control
- Test with Firebase emulator
- Ensure privacy model enforcement

### 2. Authentication Flow ⏳
- Email/password registration
- Profile creation on signup
- Persistent authentication state

### 3. Pulse Composer ⏳
- Venue selection
- Mood and caption input
- Photo upload integration
- Privacy controls

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
flutter test integration_test/
```
