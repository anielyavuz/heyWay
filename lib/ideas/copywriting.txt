## Pulse Copywriting Guidelines

### Core Terminology
- **Pulse**: Always capitalized when referring to an action or feed item; avoid "check-in" unless comparing legacy apps.
- **Pulse composer**: Use "Create Pulse" for buttons; never "Post" or "Check in".
- **Pulse Feed**: Refer to a collection of Pulses as the "Pulse feed" or "Recent Pulses".
- **Discover**: Screens that surface venues or Pulses should use "Discover" as the primary verb.

### Tone & Voice
- Friendly, optimistic, and action-oriented; focus on exploration and shared experiences.
- Emphasize collaboration ("plan together", "share Pulses") while respecting privacy.
- Keep microcopy short (under 45 characters where possible) and avoid jargon.

### Privacy & Trust Language
- Describe visibility settings as "Public", "Friends", "Private"—never expose technical terms like ACL or check-in.
- When referencing temporary sharing, use "temporary location sharing" or "share for 1 hour".

### Error & Status Messages
- Use plain language: "We couldn't load your Pulses" instead of "Fetch failed".
- Offer a clear next step ("Try again", "Check your connection").

### Localization Notes
- Turkish translations should mirror Pulse terminology (e.g., "Pulse" remains untranslated, combine with Turkish grammar: "Pulse oluştur", "Pulse paylaşıldı").
- Keep parallel structure between EN and TR bullet lists in docs for easy comparison.

### Usage Checklist
- [ ] App titles and navigational labels use "Pulse" (verified in `lib/main.dart`, `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`).
- [ ] Messaging surfaces "Pulses" instead of "check-ins" in documentation.
- [ ] New features add EN/TR copy simultaneously using `EN:`/`TR:` format in idea docs.
